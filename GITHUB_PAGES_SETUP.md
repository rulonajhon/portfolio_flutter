# GitHub Pages Configuration Instructions

## The Problem
Your GitHub Pages is currently showing the README.md content instead of the Flutter app. This means GitHub Pages is set to deploy from the repository files instead of using GitHub Actions.

## Solution Steps

### 1. Configure GitHub Pages Source
1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/rulonajhon/portfolio_flutter
2. Click on **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Pages** section in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **"GitHub Actions"** (NOT "Deploy from a branch")
5. Click **Save**

### 2. Verify GitHub Actions Workflow
1. Go to **Actions** tab: https://github.com/rulonajhon/portfolio_flutter/actions
2. Check if the "Deploy Flutter Web to GitHub Pages" workflow has run
3. If it shows errors, click on the failed run to see details
4. If it hasn't run, click **"Run workflow"** manually

### 3. Expected Behavior After Fix
- GitHub Actions will build your Flutter web app
- The built app will be deployed to GitHub Pages
- Your live site will show the actual Flutter UI with styling
- URL: https://rulonajhon.github.io/portfolio_flutter/

### 4. If Still Not Working
If you still see issues after configuring GitHub Pages:

1. **Manual Trigger**: Go to Actions tab and manually run the workflow
2. **Check Permissions**: Ensure the repository has Pages and Actions enabled
3. **Wait Time**: GitHub Pages can take 5-10 minutes to update after deployment

### 5. Alternative: Deploy to gh-pages Branch
If GitHub Actions approach doesn't work, you can use the traditional branch deployment:

```bash
# Install gh-pages (already done)
npm install gh-pages --save-dev

# Build and deploy
flutter build web --base-href "/portfolio_flutter/" --dart-define=FLUTTER_WEB_USE_SKIA=false
npx gh-pages -d build/web
```

Then set GitHub Pages source to "Deploy from a branch" and select "gh-pages" branch.

## Current Status
- ❌ GitHub Pages is showing README instead of Flutter app
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow is configured correctly
- ❌ GitHub Pages source needs to be set to "GitHub Actions"

**Action Required**: Configure GitHub Pages source to use GitHub Actions instead of branch deployment.
